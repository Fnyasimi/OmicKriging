Reading pedigree information from [ T1DCC.fam ] 
4900 individuals read from [ T1DCC.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9

Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Thinning SNP list, per-SNP probability of keeping is 0.2
Removed 308208 SNPs from thinning
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 80340 SNPs
4900 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 80340 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 4900 missing
